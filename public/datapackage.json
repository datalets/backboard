Decidim?\n\n{uri-website}[Decidim] is a participatory democracy framework, written in Ruby on Rails, originally developed for the Barcelona City government online and offline participation website.\nInstalling these libraries will provide you a generator and gems to help you develop web applications like the ones found on <<example-applications,example applications>> or like {uri-demo}[our demo application].\n\nAll members of the Decidim community agree with {uri-social-contract}[Decidim Social Contract or Code of Democratic Guarantees].\n\n'''\n\n= Table of Contents\n\n*

enjoy.\n\n[source,console]\n----\ngem install decidim\ndecidim decidim_application\n----\n\nWe have set up a guide on how to install, set up and upgrade Decidim.\nSee the {uri-docs-getting-started}[Getting started guide].\n\n== \ud83d\ude4c Contribute\n\nAnyone can participate in {uri-metadecidim}[Metadecidim], our own distance of Decidim for improving Decidim. The community is formed by people with different profiles and backgrounds.\n\nHow can you contribute? There are many ways to do it, some more specific to the software -improving documentation or translations, reporting bugs or proposing improvements-, but you can also participate in discussions about the governance of the community (find out how we organize ourselves).\n\nHaving a lively community is crucial to this project, so we encourage you to find out what is the best way for you to contribute to the commons! \ud83c\udf31\n\nRead more about contributions in our {uri-contributing}[contribution guidelines].\n\n== \ud83e\udde9 Modules\n\nIf you need to have some features that we do not have yet, we recommend that you make a module.\nThis is a Ruby on Rails engine with some APIs specific to Decidim (for registering with the menus, integration with spaces like Participatory Processes or Assemblies, with /admin or /api, etc).\n\nAs a base you can use these modules, although check first that the version is compatible with your current Decidim version.\nAlso, you should know that until v1.0.0 we are under development, and these internal APIs can change.\n\nWe recommend that you extensively test your module.\n\nSee {uri-modules}[Modules page on Decidim.org].\n\n=== \ud83e\udeaa Identity verifications and authorizations\n\nOne specific thing regarding these kind of applications is how you manage the permissions that the participants will have in the platform (aka the authorization or verification logic). This tries to solve the problem of how to verify that the user is who they say they are and that they have the right to participate in this city or organization. Read more about {uri-docs-authorizations}[Authorizations] in our documentation.\n\n=== \ud83d\udeaa Authentication options\n\nYou can easily add any authentication provider to Decidim that is provided by {uri-omniauth}[OmniAuth]. Also you have a {uri-modules-auth}[list of modules related to authorization] already developed by the community.\n\n== \ud83d\udcd8 License\n\nIf you plan to put your application in production, you will need to publish it using the same license: GPL Affero 3.\n\nWe recommend doing that on GitHub (or any other code hosting platform) before publishing.\n\nYou can read more on \"{uri-producing-oss-license}[Being Open Source From Day One is Especially Important for Government Projects]\".\n\nIf you have any trouble you can contact us on {uri-chat}[our Matrix.org chat room for developers].\n\n== \ud83d\udd0e Example applications\n\nSince Decidim is a ruby gem, you can check out the {uri-github-dependents}[dependent repositories] to see how many applications are on the wild or tests that other developers have made. You can see a highlight of {uri-docs-example-applications}[example applications] in our documentation.\n\n== \ud83d\udd12 Security\n\nSecurity is very important to us.\nIf you have any issue regarding security, please disclose the information responsibly by sending an email to security [at] decidim [dot] org and not by creating a github/metadecidim issue.\nWe appreciate your effort to make Decidim more secure.\nSee {uri-security}[full security policy].\n\n== \ud83e\udef6 Financial contributions\n\nDecidim helps citizens, organizations and public institutions to democratically self-organize at every scale. Thanks to Decidim, any organization is able to configure spaces for participation (initiatives, assemblies, or processes) and enrich them through the multiple available components (meetings, surveys, proposals, participatory budgets, accountability for results, comments, and many other).\n\nYou can contribute financially to the sustainability of this project through {uri-opencollective}[OpenCollective].\n\nThe funds will enable the maintainers to:\n\n* review community contributions\n* triage issues\n* fix bugs related to performance\n* improve the design of the platform\n* write better documentation\n* improve performance of the platform security\n\n=== \ud83e\uddd1 Members\n\nMembers have the right to participate in all the participation spaces of the {uri-metadecidim}[Metadecidim] platform with voice and vote, exercise their vote in strategic and internal decisions, elect or be elected in representative bodies, request and obtain explanations about the management of the positions of the Association, receive information about the activities and make common uses that are established. Read more about becoming a {uri-opencollective-members}[Decidim association member].\n\nimage::https://opencollective.com/decidim/tiers/member.svg?avatarHeight=36&width=600[Members]\n\n=== \ud83d\udcbb Partners\n\nAny organization offering services on Decidim can contribute back to the commons by becoming a Partner. Each Partner commits to include a clause in each new service contract around Decidim, explicitly stating that a small percentage is allocated to the maintenance of the source code. For a company, the percentage is 3%, and for a nonprofit organization, it is 1.5%.

Currently supported are macOS, Windows, and most Linux distributions (via Debian- and Fedora-packages as well as AppImages).\r\n\r\nOn our website and here on GitHub, we provide a set of installers for the most common use-cases. We provide both 64-bit installers as well as installers for ARM systems (called \"Apple Silicon\" in the macOS ecosystem). 32-bit is not supported. We offer the following binaries directly:\r\n\r\n* Windows (x64)\r\n* macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)\r\n* Debian and Fedora (x64 and ARM)\r\n* AppImage (x64 and ARM)\r\n\r\nThanks to our community, we can also offer you a variety of other installation opportunities:\r\n\r\n* [Chocolatey (Windows)](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/zettlr/)\r\n* [Homebrew (macOS)](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/zettlr)\r\n* [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zettlr)\r\n* [Flatpak (Linux)](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.zettlr.Zettlr)\r\n\r\nAll other [platforms that Electron supports](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/development/build-instructions-gn#platform-prerequisites) are supported as well, but you will need to build the app yourself for this to work.\r\n\r\n**Please also consider [becoming a patron](https://www.patreon.com/zettlr) or making a [one-time donation](https://paypal.me/hendrikerz)!**\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nAfter you have installed Zettlr, [head over to our documentation](https://docs.zettlr.com/) to get to know Zettlr. Refer to the [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.zettlr.com/en/5-minutes/), if you prefer to use software heads-on.\r\n\r\n![The central window of Zettlr using the dark theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/develop//resources/screenshots/zettlr_view_dark.png)\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nAs an Open Source application, Zettlr always welcomes contributions from the community. **You do not need to know how to write code to help!** A full overview over all the areas where you can help can be found in our [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md). Here, we introduce you to the two biggest areas where we welcome help: translations and contributing code.\r\n\r\n### Translating\r\n\r\nThe development team maintains the English and German translations, but lacks adequate knowledge of other languages. All the other available translations have been created by our community.\r\n\r\nZettlr's translations utilize the [gettext system](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/). This means that the translations are kept in PO-files within the [`static/lang` directory](./static/lang).\r\n\r\nTo update a translation, simply download the corresponding language file and edit it. You can edit PO-files with a simple text editor, but if you prefer a more comfortable graphical editor, there are many out there. One good option is the Open Source editor [POedit](https://poedit.net/).\r\n\r\nAs soon as you are happy with your changes, open a Pull Request here that updates the corresponding file. GitHub has created a great [guide on how to open Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files#editing-files-in-another-users-repository).\r\n\r\n### Contributing Code\r\n\r\nZettlr is an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)-based app, so to start developing, you'll need to have the following installed on your computer:\r\n\r\n1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/). Make sure it's at least Node 20 (`lts/iron`). To test what version you have, run `node -v`.\r\n2. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/). This is the package manager for the project, as we do not commit `package-lock.json`-files and many commands require yarn. You can install this globally using `npm install -g yarn` or Homebrew, if you are on macOS.\r\n3. On Windows, we recommend to [install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), which will make many of the next steps easier.\r\n4. A few command-line utilities that various scripts require for running the development builds:\r\n    * [`cURL`](https://curl.se/download.html) (required by the Pandoc download script)\r\n    * `unzip` (required by the Pandoc download script)\r\n    * [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) (required by the i18n script)\r\n5. An appropriate build toolchain for your operating system, since Zettlr requires a few native C++-modules that must be compiled before running the app:\r\n    * **macOS**: On macOS, installing the XCode command-line tools via `xcode-select --install` suffices\r\n    * **Windows**: On Windows, you'll need the [free Visual Studio development tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/) that include the required tools\r\n    * **Linux**: On Linux, there are a variety of compatible toolchains available, sometimes they are already preinstalled. Refer to your distribution's manual for more information.\r\n\r\nThen, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies on your local computer:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr.git\r\n$ cd Zettlr\r\n$ yarn install --immutable\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `--immutable` flag ensures that yarn will stick to the versions as listed in the `yarn.lock` and not attempt to update them.\r\n\r\nDuring development, hot module reloading (HMR) is active so that you can edit the renderer's code easily and hit `F5` after the changes have been compiled by `electron-forge`. You can keep the developer tools open to see when HMR has finished loading your changes.\r\n\r\n### What Should I Know To Contribute Code?\r\n\r\nIn order to provide code, you should have basic familiarity with the following topics and/or manuals (ordered by descending importance):\r\n\r\n* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) (especially asynchronous code) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)\r\n* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/)\r\n* [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs)\r\n* [Vue.js 3.x](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) and [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)\r\n* [CodeMirror 6.x](https://codemirror.net/docs/)\r\n* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)\r\n* [LESS](https://lesscss.org/#)\r\n* [Webpack 5.x](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/)\r\n* [Electron forge](https://www.electronforge.io/)\r\n* [Electron builder](https://www.electron.build/)\r\n\r\n> [!TIP]\r\n> See the \"Directory Structure\" section below to get an idea of how Zettlr specifically works.\r\n\r\n### Development Commands\r\n\r\nThis section lists all available commands that you can use during application development. These are defined within the `package.json` and can be run from the command line by prefixing them with `yarn`. Run them from within the base directory of the repository.\r\n\r\n#### `start`\r\n\r\nUse this command to carefree test any changes you make to the application. This command will start the application, but will provide a custom configuration and a custom directory. Thus, it will not touch any files that a regular Zettlr installation will use.\r\n\r\n**The first time you start this command**, pass the `--clean`-flag to copy a bunch of test-files to your `./resources`-directory, create a `test-config.yml` in your project root, and start the application with this clean configuration. Then, you can adapt the `test-config.yml` to your liking (so that certain settings which you would otherwise _always_ set will be pre-set without you having to open the preferences).\r\n\r\nWhenever you want to reset the test directory to its initial state (or you removed the directory, or cloned the whole project anew), pass the flag `--clean` to the command in order to create or reset the directory. **This is also necessary if you changed something in `test-config.yml`**.\r\n\r\nIf you want to prevent a config-file from being created (e.g., to simulate the first start experience), you can pass the flag `--no-config` to this command.\r\n\r\nYou can pass additional command-line switches such as `--clear-cache` to this command as well. They will be passed to the child process.\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]\r\n> Attention: Before first running the command, you **must** run it with the `--clean`-flag to create the directory in the first place!\r\n\r\nAdditionally, have a look at our [full development documentation](https://docs.zettlr.com/en/get-involved).\r\n\r\n#### `package`\r\n\r\nPackages the application, but not bundle it into an installer. Without any suffix, this command will package the application for your current platform and architecture. To create specific packages (may require running on the corresponding platform), the following suffixes are available:\r\n\r\n- `package:mac-x64` (Intel-based Macs)\r\n- `package:mac-arm` (Apple Silicon-based Macs)\r\n- `package:win-x64` (Intel-based Windows)\r\n- `package:linux-x64` (Intel-based Linux)\r\n- `package:linux-arm` (ARM-based Linux)\r\n\r\nThe resulting application packages are stored in `./out`.\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> This command will skip typechecking to speed up builds, so we recommend running `lint` before packaging to ensure that there are no errors.\r\n\r\n#### `release:{platform-arch}`\r\n\r\nPackages the application and then bundles it into an installer for the corresponding platform and architecture. To create such a bundle (may require running on the corresponding platform), one of the following values for `{platform-arch}` is required:\r\n\r\n- `release:mac-x64` (Intel-based Macs)\r\n- `release:mac-arm` (Apple Silicon-based Macs)\r\n- `release:win-x64` (Intel-based Windows)\r\n- `release:linux-x64` (Intel-based Linux)\r\n- `release:linux-arm` (ARM-based Linux)\r\n\r\nThe resulting setup bundles are stored in `./release`.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> While you can `package` directly for your platform without any suffix, you need to specify the platform and architecture when creating a release bundle, since electron-builder would otherwise include the development-dependencies in the `app.asar`, resulting in a bloated application.\r\n\r\n#### `csl:refresh`\r\n\r\nThis downloads the [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/) (CSL) files with which the application is shipped, and places them in the `static/csl-locales`- and `static/csl-styles`-directories respectively.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> This command is intended for an automated workflow that runs from time to time on the repository to perform this action. **Do not commit updated files to the repository**. Instead, the updated files will be downloaded whenever you `git fetch`.\r\n\r\n#### `lint`\r\n\r\nRuns [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). Apps such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) will automatically run ESLint in the background on your open files. This command runs them across the entire code base. Make sure to run this command prior to submitting a Pull Request.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> This command will run automatically on each Pull Request to check your code for inconsistencies.\r\n\r\n#### `shortcut:install`\r\n\r\nCreates a `.desktop`-file into your applications which enables you to quickly start an app that you have compiled from source. This requires Linux. To use new changes, simple sync the repository, run `package` again, and you're good to go.\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]\r\n> We provide this command as a convenience. Unless you know what you are doing, you should not run code directly compiled from the HEAD commit of the develop branch. This command *can* be useful, however, in a few instances where you know what may go wrong and can take appropriate precautions.\r\n\r\n### `shortcut:uninstall`\r\n\r\nRemoves the `.desktop`-file created by `shortcut:install`.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> You don't have to uninstall and reinstall the shortcut whenever you compile the binary anew. Just make sure that Zettlr is closed before you recompile it. You should only have to reinstall the shortcut if the template (in `scripts/assets/zettlr-dev.desktop`) has changed.\r\n\r\n#### `test`\r\n\r\nThis runs the unit tests in the directory `./test`. Make sure to run this command prior to submitting a Pull Request, as this will be run every time you commit to the PR, and this way you can make sure that your changes don't break any tests, making the whole PR-process easier.\r\n\r\n#### `test-gui`\r\n\r\nSee `start`.\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> This command is deprecated and only an alias for `start`. Use `start` instead.\r\n\r\n### Directory Structure\r\n\r\nZettlr is a mature app that has amassed hundreds of directories over the course of its development. Since it is hard to contribute to an application without any guidance, we have compiled a short description of the directories with how they interrelate.\r\n\r\n<!-- File tree generated with `tree -d -L 4 -I node_modules .` in root -->\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 out                         # Contains unpackaged binaries after running any `package` command\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 release                     # Contains distributables after running any `release` command\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 resources                   # General resource files\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 NSIS                    # Windows installer bitmaps\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 icons                   # Various icon formats\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 screenshots             # Contains the main screenshots\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts                     # Scripts used during the build process and CI pipeline \r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 assets                  # Assets for the script files\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 test-gui                # A full file tree used with the `test-gui` command\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 source                      # This is the actual source filetree\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 app                     # Main process components\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 service-providers   # Service providers that handle most of the business logic\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 util                # Utility functions for the main process\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 common                  # Shared files between various renderer processes\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 img                 # Images used in various places\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 modules             # Shared modules\r\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 markdown-editor # Main Markdown editor\r\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 markdown-utils  # MD Utilities such as md2html converter\r\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 preload         # Electron preload files\r\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 window-register # Run by every renderer during setup\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 util                # General utility functions\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 vue                 # Shared Vue components\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 pinia                   # Renderer state management\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 types                   # Types-only directory; deprecated\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 win-about               # About dialog window\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 win-assets              # Assets Manager\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 win-error               # Error window\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 win-log-viewer          # Log Viewer\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 win-main                # Main window\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 win-paste-image         # Paste-Image-dialog\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 win-preferences         # Preferences window\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 win-print               # Print preview\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 win-project-properties  # Project properties\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 win-splash-screen       # The splash screen\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 win-stats               # Statistics window\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 win-tag-manager         # Tag manager\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 win-update              # Updater\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 static                      # Contains static resources\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 csl-locales             # CSL locale files\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 csl-styles              # CSL styles\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 defaults                # Default defaults/Pandoc profiles\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 dict                    # Dictionaries that ship with the app\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 fonts                   # Fonts that ship with the app\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 lang                    # Language and i18n-related files\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 lua-filter              # Default Lua-filters\r\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 tutorial                # Tutorial files in various languages\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 test                        # Unit tests\r\n```\r\n\r\n### On the Distinction between Modules and Service Providers\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that Zettlr contains both \"modules\" and \"service providers\". The difference between the two is simple: Service providers run in the main process and are completely autonomous while providing functionality to the app as a whole. Modules, on the other hand, provide functionality that must be triggered by user actions (e.g. the exporter and the importer).\r\n\r\n### The Application Lifecycle\r\n\r\nWhenever you run Zettlr, the following steps will be executed:\r\n\r\n0. Execute `source/main.ts`\r\n1. Environment check (`source/app/lifecycle.ts::bootApplication`)\r\n2. Boot service providers (`source/app/lifecycle.ts::bootApplication`)\r\n3. Boot main application (`source/main/zettlr.ts`)\r\n4. Load the file tree and the documents\r\n5. Show the main window\r\n\r\nAnd when you shut down the app, the following steps will run:\r\n\r\n1. Close all windows except the main window\r\n2. Attempt to close the main window\r\n3. Shutdown the main application (`source/main/zettlr.ts::shutdown`)\r\n4. Shutdown the service providers (`source/app/lifecycle.ts::shutdownApplication`)\r\n5. Exit the application\r\n\r\nDuring development of the app (`yarn start` and `yarn test-gui`), the following steps will run:\r\n\r\n1. Electron forge will compile the code for the main process and each renderer process separately (since these are separate processes), using TypeScript and webpack to compile and transpile.\r\n2. Electron forge will put that code into the directory `.webpack`, replacing the constants you can find in the \"create\"-methods of the window manager with the appropriate entry points.\r\n3. Electron forge will start a few development servers to provide hot module reloading (HMR) and then actually start the application.\r\n\r\nWhenever the app is built, the following steps will run:\r\n\r\n1. Electron forge will perform steps 1 and 2 above, but instead of running the app, it will package the resulting code into a functional app package.\r\n2. Electron builder will then take these pre-built packages and wrap them in a platform-specific installer (DMG-files, Windows installer, or Linux packages).\r\n\r\nElectron forge will put the packaged applications into the directory `./out` while Electron builder will put the installers into the directory `./release`.\r\n\r\n## Command-Line Switches\r\n\r\nThe Zettlr binary features a few command line switches that you can make use of for different purposes.\r\n\r\n#### `--launch-minimized`\r\n\r\nThis CLI flag will instruct Zettlr not to show the main window on start. This is useful to create autostart entries. In that case, launching Zettlr with this flag at system boot will make sure that you will only see its icon in the tray.\r\n\r\nSince this implies the need to have the app running in the tray bar or notification area when starting the app like this, it will automatically set the corresponding setting `system.leaveAppRunning` to true.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> This flag will not have any effect on Linux systems which do not support displaying an icon in a tray bar or notification area.\r\n\r\n#### `--clear-cache`\r\n\r\nThis will direct the File System Abstraction Layer to fully clear its cache on boot. This can be used to mitigate issues regarding changes in the code base. To ensure compatibility with any changes to the information stored in the cache, the cache is also automatically cleared when the version field in your `config.json` does not match the one in the `package.json`, which means that, as long as you do not explicitly set the `version`-field in your `test-config.yml`, the cache will always be cleared on each run when you type `yarn test-gui`.\r\n\r\n> [!TIP]\r\n> If you just want to casually clear the cache for troubleshooting, you can also clear the cache by selecting the appropriate menu item in the \"Help\" menu, which saves you from having to dabble with anything technical.\r\n\r\n#### `--data-dir=path`\r\n\r\nUse this switch to specify a custom data directory, which holds your configuration files. Without this switch, the data directory defaults to `%AppData%/Zettlr` (on Windows 10 and newer), `~/.config/Zettlr` (on Linux), or `~/Library/Application Support/Zettlr` (on macOS). The path can be absolute or relative. Basis for the relative path will be either the binary's directory (when running a packaged app) or the repository root (when running an app that is not packaged). Remember to escape spaces or quote the path, if necessary. The `~` character to denote the home directory is not expanded in this case, so make sure to pass the entire path to your home directory if necessary. Due to a minor bug in Electron, an empty `Dictionaries` subdirectory is created in the default data directory, but it does not impact functionality.\r\n\r\n#### `--disable-hardware-acceleration`\r\n\r\nThis switch causes Zettlr to disable hardware acceleration, which could be necessary in certain setups. For more information on why this flag was added, see issue [#2127](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/issues/2127).\r\n\r\n## VSCode Extension Recommendations\r\n\r\nThis repository makes use of Visual Studio Code's [recommended extensions feature](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=827846). This means: If you use VS Code and open the repository for the first time, VS Code will tell you that the repository recommends to install a handful of extensions. These extensions are recommended if you work with Zettlr and will make contributing much easier. The recommendations are specified in the file `.vscode/extensions.json`.\r\n\r\nSince installing extensions is sometimes a matter of taste, we have added short descriptions for each recommended extension within that file to explain why we recommend it. This way you can make your own decision whether or not you want to install any of these extensions (for example, the SVG extension is not necessary if you do not work with the SVG files provided in the repository).\r\n\r\nIf you choose not to install all of the recommended extensions at once (which we recommend), VS Code will show you the recommendations in the extensions sidebar so you can first decide which of the ones you'd like to install and then manually install those you'd like to have.\r\n\r\n> [!TIP]\r\n> Using the same extensions as the core developer team will make the code generally more consistent since you will have the same visual feedback.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis software is licensed via the [GNU GPL v3-License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).\r\n\r\nThe brand (including name, icons and everything Zettlr can be identified with) is excluded and all rights reserved.

If you're interested in contributing to PlaceCal please get in touch at support@placecal.org\n\nTo get an idea of the project and what we're about, check out [the handbook](https://handbook.placecal.org/).\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo run PlaceCal locally you will need to install the following dependencies:\n\n- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\n- [Ruby 3.3.4](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)\n- [Node.js 20.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download) & (optional) [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage it\n- [Yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)\n- [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) for image manipulation\n- [Graphviz](https://voormedia.github.io/rails-erd/install.html) for documentation diagrams\n- [Chrome/Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/) for system tests along with a matching version of [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)\n\n## Quickstart with docker for GFSC devs\n\nMake sure all of the above dependencies are installed (and ask someone to add your public ssh key to the servers if you are staff).\n\nThen make sure the docker daemon is running, and run\n\n```sh\nmake setup_with_docker\n```\n\nLocal site is now running at `lvh.me:3000`\n\nSome other useful commands for developing can be found in the makefile.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf the make command fails and you can't work out why, here are some suggestions:\n\n- Do you have an older version of the database hanging around? Try running `rails db:drop:all`\n- Is the docker daemon running?\n- Is the port in use by another application or docker container? Try stopping or removing any conflicting containers\n- Are you using the correct node version? Try running `nvm use`\n\n## Quickstart for everyone else\n\n### Set up Postgresql locally with docker\n\nIf you don't already have Postgresql installed and running, you can set it up with docker, just run `make docker`. To tear down the docker setup, run `make clean`.\n\n### Run the setup script\n\n```sh\nbin/setup\n```\n\nAmongst other things, this will create an admin user for you:\n\n- Username: `root@placecal.org`\n- Password: `password`\n\n### Run the thing\n\n- Start the server with `bin/dev`\n- Make sure you use `lvh.me:3000` instead of `localhost:3000` or you **will** have authentication problems\n- The admin interface is at `admin.lvh.me:3000`\n- Access code docs through your local filesystem and update them with `bin/rails yard`\n\n### Importing calendars\n\nTo import all events, run the following command.\n\n```sh\nrails events:import_all_calendars\n```\n\nAfter this has run once, the following command can be run which attempts to skip calendars which have not been updated. This should be run regularly on a cron in production environments. If you are using dokku to deploy like we are, this is handled in the `app.json` config file.\n\n```sh\nrails events:scan_for_calendars_needing_import\n```\n\nTo import one calendar, run:\n\n```sh\nrails events:import_calendar[100]\n\n# nb: zsh users will need to escape brackets\nrails events:import_calendar\\[100\\]\n```\n\n## Testing, linting and formatting\n\nPlaceCal tests are written in minitest. We use Rubocop to lint our Ruby code.\n\nWe use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format everything it's able to parse. We run this automatically as part of a pre-commit hook.\n\nYou can run the tests & rubocop with:\n\n```sh\nmake test\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nFurther documentation for PlaceCal is in the [PlaceCal Handbook](https://handbook.placecal.org/).\n\nThe developer Procfile will load a `yard` language server, this is visible at `http://localhost:8808`.\n\nIf you are working with the code and are completely lost you can also try the [GFSC discord server](http://discord.gfsc.studio) where you can prod a human for answers.\n\n### Generating new components\n\nWe use view_component to make components, and you can create a new one by running `rails g component <Name> <args>`\nPreviously this system used mountain view, and some of the components are still generated using this.\n\nMore info here: https://viewcomponent.org/guide/generators.html\n\n## API\n\nAPI examples and test environment are provided using [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/).\n\nInstall it with your system package manager then point it at the `collections` directory.\n\n## Donations\n\nIf you'd like to support development, please consider sending us a one-off or regular donation on Ko-fi. You can do this through the \"support\" button in GitHub at the top of this repo.\n","autotext_url":"https://github.com/geeksforsocialchange/PlaceCal","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"https://github.com/geeksforsocialchange/PlaceCal/issues","created_at":"2024-10-18T13:24","download_url":"https://github.com/geeksforsocialchange/PlaceCal/releases","event_name":"The Tech We Want","event_url":"https://meta.dribdat.cc/event/25","excerpt":"> \ud83c\udd70\ufe0f\u2139\ufe0f Imagine a platform that unites your community by effortlessly bringing together information about local groups, events, and activities.
